# Deep Learning

Deep Learning (also known as structured deep learning, hierarchical learning, or deep machine learning) is a field of machine learning which is based on a set of algorithms that attempts to model high-level data abstractions through the use of a multi-layered deep graph composed of several linear and non-linear transformations.


# The project itself
The goal of this project is to learn how a deep neural network works in various types of situations and how we can improve it. This project is developed with Python and the Tensorflow library.
